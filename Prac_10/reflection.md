# Reflections on Prac 10

## Estimates for Practical Tasks

Throughout this course, the initial accuracy of my estimates for practical tasks varied. As a beginner, I sometimes found it difficult to gauge the time required for certain tasks. However, as I gradually grew comfortable with the coding environment and became more familiar with the tasks, I noticed a significant improvement in my estimation accuracy.

This improvement came primarily from the experience and deeper understanding of the task complexities that I gained during the course. Additionally, I learned the importance of considering potential obstacles and uncertainties while estimating, which helped me provide more accurate and realistic estimates over time.

## Code Reviews

Participating in code reviews has been an enlightening experience. Being reviewed has taught me to appreciate feedback and constructively incorporate it into my work. It allowed me to see different perspectives and approaches to a problem, enhancing my problem-solving skills.

On the other hand, reviewing others' codes has helped me hone my critical thinking and analytical skills. It has taught me to read and understand code from a wider perspective, including aspects of readability, efficiency, and maintainability.

The mutual learning from code reviews, both as a reviewer and a reviewee, has significantly enhanced my programming skills and knowledge.

## Feedback on Practical Tasks

If I were in charge of the subject, I would propose a few changes to the practical tasks. I would introduce more real-world examples that connect theory and practice. This could better prepare students for professional coding environments.

I also believe that more emphasis on collaborative tasks would be beneficial. Collaboration is a crucial part of software development, and it's something that can be effectively learned and practiced in a controlled environment like this.

Finally, I would suggest more varied and frequent code review exercises, allowing students to receive and give feedback more often, promoting continuous learning and improvement.
